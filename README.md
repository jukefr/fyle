fyle is a suite of tools for **web asset optimization, conversion and processing**.

It's intention is to be as **easy to use** as possible (while also being as **easy to develop for** as possible).
Different options are available to use it, directly call the **docker container**, use **fcli** and maybe more to come.

For now **Linux** and **macos** are supported, Windows is untested.

To run any of this you will need to have **Docker**.

All the documentation is now hosted on Github Pages, [check it out](https://jukefr.github.io/fyle/) (or check out `/docs` if you're that kind of person)
